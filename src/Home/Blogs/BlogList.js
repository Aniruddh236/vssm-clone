        descriptionInEnglish:`To harm someone is violence. In my view, such a broad definition of violence cannot be accepted. There are also subtle forms of violence that we engage in. For example, making someone homeless is also violence. In the last hundred to one hundred fifty years, we have taken away the homes of millions—perhaps billions—of animals and birds. We have cut down trees and stripped them of their shelter. In my opinion, this is a very significant form of violence.

Humanity continues to strip countless people of their shelter, while trees and forests are still being cut down. We must try to compensate for the damage humanity has done to nature. We are currently working to plant 1.25 million trees in 125 villages, with the help of friends associated with VSSM.

In the cremation ground of the Thakore community in Ludra, Banaskantha, we planted over 5,000 trees three years ago with the help of Astral Pipes and the respected Tusharbhai Shah. The planted trees are growing beautifully. There was a time when the question was where to sit during cremations, but now there is shade everywhere in the cremation ground. Countless lives have made this place their home. You can also carry out such initiatives in your village; this will please nature.

descriptionInGujarati: `કોઈને મારવું એજ હિંસા.. મારા ખ્યાલથી હિંસાનો આવો સ્થૂળ અર્થ ન કરી શકાય. કેટલીક સૂક્ષ્મ હિંસા પણ આપણે કરીયે…

દા.ત. કોઈને બેઘર કરી દેવું એ પણ હિંસા. પાછલા સો દોઢસો વર્ષમાં આપણે લાખો – કરોડો પશુ પક્ષીઓના ઘર છીનવી લીધા. વૃક્ષો કાપી તેમનો આશરો છીનવી લીધો છે.. મારા મતે આ બહુ મોટી હિંસા….

માનવજાત અસંખ્ય લોકોનો આશરો છીનવીને પણ ક્યાં અટકી હજુ વૃક્ષો- જંગલો કપાઈ જ રહ્યા છે. માનવજાતે પ્રકૃતિનું જે નુકશાન કર્યું તેને સરભર કરવા અમે કોશીશ કરીએ. 12.50 લાખ વૃક્ષો 125 ગ્રામવનોમાં વાવી ઉછેરવાનું કરી રહ્યા છીએ. એમાં VSSM સાથે સંકળાયેલા સ્વજનો મદદ કરે.

બનાસકાંઠાનું લુદ્રા – ઠાકોર સમાજની સ્મશાન ભૂમિમાં અમે 5000 થી વધારે વૃક્ષો એસ્ટ્રલ પાઈપ અને આદરણીય તુષારભાઈ શાહની મદદથી ત્રણેક વર્ષ પહેલા વાવ્યા. 

વાવેલા વૃક્ષો એકદમ સરસ ઉછરી રહ્યા છે.  એક સમય હતો સ્મશાનમાં મૃતદેહના અગ્નિ સંસ્કાર થતા હોય એ વખતે ક્યાં બેસવું એ સવાલ હતો આજે સ્મશાનમાં છાંયડો જ છાંયડો. અસંખ્ય જીવો સ્મશાનમાં પોતાનું ઘર બનાવ્યું. તમારા ગામમાં પણ તમે આવા કાર્યો કરી શકો.. એનાથી પ્રકૃતિ રાજી થશે…

        descriptionInEnglish:`Naran... When he was small, he was called Naran, but now, as he has grown in experience and age, he is referred to as Naranbhai.

He completed his education and joined VSSM as a Bal Dost (child friend). At that time, VSSM was working on a small scale. In many settlements of nomadic communities, not a single child was attending school. Naran started his work as a Bal Dost in the Mira settlement in Diyodar.

His dedication to work is remarkable. Without limiting himself to Diyodar, he took on the responsibilities of working with nomadic communities throughout Banaskantha. A true team leader inspires others to rise alongside him. Gradually, Naranbhai established a strong team in Banaskantha that could diligently carry out the organization’s work. He continuously keeps this team united and active.

Alongside addressing the primary issues of nomadic communities, we also started water management projects and tree planting initiatives in North Gujarat. Naranbhai became the leader of these efforts.

Today, we have successfully planted over 1.2 million trees and deepened 300 ponds, all thanks to the entire team's efforts. However, the main responsibility was taken up by him.

This year, Naranbhai received the Van Pandit Award from the Chief Minister. It was a truly proud moment. Just like a peacock always dances with its feathers... VSSM shines through its workers, and such events bring honor.

Receiving recognition as a caretaker and maintainer of forests, we all felt grateful.

We wish Naranbhai continued success in life and hope he prepares a strong team at VSSM like himself... and may he receive many more awards like this one.

Naranbhai’s progress is significantly supported by the local team at VSSM, but the biggest contribution comes from his wife, Nayna, and their two children. They dedicated their time to Naranbhai, allowing this wonderful work for the livelihood of beings to happen. We are indebted to Naranbhai’s family.

Thank you, honorable Chief Minister, for recognizing a true gem... and best wishes for even greater achievements ahead.

        descriptionInEnglish:`The birth of a son at their daughter's house filled them with immense joy. They distributed sweets and gave gifts to the newborn. However, Vyoma Ben, who lives in Mumbai, felt that something was still missing.

She decided to give a memorable gift to the little Arjun by donating to the Arjun village forest. With Arjun's growth, many lives found shelter as the trees began to flourish.

Within a year, the trees planted in the fields of Vav, Banaskantha, thrived beautifully. Vyoma Ben then created Chandragram in memory of her father.

In 2023, she established Maitrigrama to commemorate the enduring friendship of her four cousins.

With her help, a total of 8,763 trees were planted in Dharadhara, Kunwarva, Padar, and Vagharol in Banaskantha, out of which 7,329 are thriving.

Vyoma Ben, who is sensitive towards nature, believes that everyone should plant and nurture at least 150 trees in their lifetime. Only then can we restore the damaged environment to its former richness.

By planting 8,763 trees, Vyoma Ben and her loved ones have given back to nature, properly caring for the trees they planted. I salute her commitment.

Arjun's grandmother, Archana Ben Parikh, and her family, through the Parikh Foundation, have helped nurture over 50,000 trees. I had the chance to meet them at Vyoma Ben's place. I will share more about their family sometime in the future.

Recently, when I visited Mumbai, I had the opportunity to go to Vyoma Ben's house. She holds us in great affection, for which I am grateful.

Like Vyoma Ben, you too can contribute to creating small forests or plant a designated number of trees in memory of your loved ones by contacting 90999-36013 between 10 AM and 6 PM.

Let’s come together to adorn this earth with greenery.`

        descriptionInEnglish:`Sunil, our worker from Vadodara, showed our driver Darshan the way to Amodard village, saying we were going to meet Daria Ba. We arrived at the Rathodiya Faliya in the village. The car stopped outside the Faliya, and we walked to Daria Ba's home.

Though we called it a home, whether to refer to it as such was questionable. Daria Ba was seated amidst the decay of her surroundings, her frail body barely visible. At first glance, it resembled the vision of hell.

One of her sons is mentally challenged. He wanders off but eventually returns to Daria Ba for food. Daria Ba survives with the help of her neighbors, who occasionally provide her with sustenance.

Realizing the situation, we started providing rations every month. The kind neighbors also bring firewood, enabling her to cook.

Food and drink seemed to be a distant luxury, but seeing the condition of the hut where she lives... words fail to capture the despair.

On the day we visited, it was unbearably hot. It was hard to imagine Ba living in such heat.

Even going to the toilet or bathroom was a huge struggle.

Given the situation, we decided to build her a small house. Our Kishor uncle (Kishorbhai Patel) helped with this. In memory of our dear Kushalbhai, we decided to prepare this new home and started the construction.

We express our gratitude to those who helped us provide rations to Daria Ba, and we bow to Kishor uncle for assisting in building her home.

Imagining the comfort Ba will find in this house is difficult. Just thinking about the monsoon and the conditions she endured is unsettling.

It’s a blessing to be a part of bringing relief to the lives of so many individuals.

You can also join in such efforts. You can help... For assistance, please contact 90999-36013 between 11 AM and 6 PM.`
